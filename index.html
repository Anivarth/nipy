<p>Nipy is a Python3 blog engine based on Flask micro framework.</p>

<p>I was thinking to make a full-functional Blog engine like Wordpress but unfortunately I am shutting down this project due to some personal issues. If you feel happy to take this project to the next level, you're most welcome.</p>

<p>I lost the main project due to a Hard-Drive lost. I have gained this one from my bitbucket, has a lots of bugs. Please fix them, I have fixed them almost all of them but lost due to a unwanted HDD fail.</p>

<p>Also, in this project, I have done less comment, actually trying to make my code readable even without comment. Don't know I have passed or failed.</p>

<p>Have a nice time buddy!</p>

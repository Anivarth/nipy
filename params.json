If you feel happy to take this project to the next level, you're most welcome.\r\n\r\nI lost the main project due to a Hard-Drive lost. I have gained this one from my bitbucket, has a lots of bugs. Please fix them, I have fixed them almost all of them but lost due to a unwanted HDD fail.\r\n\r\nAlso, in this project, I have done less comment, actually trying to make my code readable even without comment. Don't know I have passed or failed.\r\n\r\nHave a nice time buddy!\r\n",
